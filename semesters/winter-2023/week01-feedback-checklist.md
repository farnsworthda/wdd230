- [ ] Be sure to use proper folder designations for your reference files. See File and Folder Naming Rules as a guide. `kabob-case needs to be used for names of folders, files, css class names and html element-ids. You need to update your image file, css file, and css classes`

You should end up with three folders in the root of your repository named as shown here:

- [x] styles
- [x] images
- [x] scripts

- [x] Use a header, main, and footer element.

- [ ] Center all the content on the page and limit the width as shown. `You need to center your text`


- [x] Use a grid or flex display in the header to get the layout as shown.

Meet each of the following standard checklist items:

- [x] The doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of your HTML page.

- [x] The charset declared (UTF-8) is declared correctly. 

- [x] The viewport is declared correctly.

- [x] A meaningful title is used on the page.

- [ ] A meta description is provided, it is unique and doesn't possess more than 150 characters. `Break up long text over multiple lines left aligned.`

- [x] The HTML document is validated through the W3C Markup Validation Service . 
    Review and identify those relevant issues in the markup.  Use ☝ Web Developer or the W3C Markup Validation Site.

- [x] Semantic elements are used appropriately and where feasible throughout the document.  
  Example: Use <header> and not <div id="header"> - In addition, do not use class nor id attributes unless it is necessary for styling or script.

- [x] There are no broken links on the page. ☝ Web Developer | W3C Link Checker

- [x] All embedded or inline CSS is avoided in the HTML document.

- [ ] If ID attributes are used, they are unique to a page. Do not use them if you really do not need to use them. `You need to use id elements for your JavaScript. Using Css for that purpose will result in issues.`

- [x] The CSS is validated through the W3C CSS Validation Service . ☝ Web Developer

- [ ] The portrait (self or family) image is optimized to be rendered in the browser. `Per your design your image only needs to be 200 x 250px.  Resize it and compress it to optimize it.`

- [ ] Use basic optimization techniques such as cropping, resizing, and adjusting the image quality using an editor of your choice or preference. See the Assignment Help section for a demonstration. `Per your design your image only needs to be 200 x 250px.  Resize it and compress it to optimize it.`

- [ ] The `<img>` elements have an alternative text which describes the image. `Alternative text needs to be human readable. Consider, what would you want a screen reader to say when it reads the image?`

- [x] JavaScript code is not mixed with your HTML code inline. Use external JavaScript file(s) and only reference the file in the head section or right before the body tag is closed.

- [x] The current year is placed after the © symbol in the footer using JavaScript and the document method querySelector to complete this task.

- [x] The date and time that the file was last modified is labeled and dynamically driven using JavaScript in the footer using any DOM manipulation method (getElementById, querySelector, etc.).

- [x] No JavaScript errors are found and do not use the document.write() method in this course.

- [x] The language (lang) attribute of your website is specified and related to the language of the current page.

- [x] Headings should be used properly and in the right order. Do NOT skip heading levels. Headings are to be used to outline the content of the page and not for styling purposes.

- [x] This page should use two headings, h1 and h2.

- [x] The page should pass the basic accessibility standards using the WAVE tool . ☝ Web Developer including color contrast.
