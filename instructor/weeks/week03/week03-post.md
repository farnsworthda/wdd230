## Welcome to Week 03 - Website Planning and Group Participation

Hi Class,

Welcome to week 3! This week we have a number of exciting activities planned for you.  You will be Joining your Teaching and Learning Team, Planning your website and gaining experience with some tools that will help you communicate your questions and answers better.

### Gospel Insights into Web Tech
I love truth in all of its forms and can see true principles more clearly when there is overlap from one knowledge domain to another.  That is very true as we explore Web Frontend Development. Shortly after translating the golden plates into the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith felt a great urgency to translate the Bible.  As he looked at the pages of Genesis his mind was opened to the conversation or experience that Moses had when he was called to be a prophet. Moses had a dramatic vision where God told him

 >33 And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.
 >
 >34 And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many.
 >
 >35 But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you.
 >[Moses 1:33-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p33-p35#p33)

After this declaration he begins to describe the creation of the earth which is what we have in the first chapters of Genesis.  There is a curious statement made in [Genesis 2:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/2?lang=eng&id=p4-p5#p4):

 >4 Â¶ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
 >
 >5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

So if there was not a man to till the ground what was happening in Genesis chapter 1? Logic suggests that it was a plan.  This was pointed out to me by a Christian not of my faith while on my mission. The clarity of this truth however is expressed to a greater degree in Joseph Smith's translation of the Book of Abraham.  Abraham had a similar experience to Moses where he was shown our pre-mortal life and the plan for our earth experience.  After Abraham was shown "the intelligences that were organized before the world was" ([Abraham 3:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)) he saw God and Christ counsel with the noble and great ones and Christ said "We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell" ([Abraham 3:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). The language of this council expresses a detailed plan of what the earth would be similar to what is found in Genesis chapter 1.  The council concludes with:
 >And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because that on the seventh time they would rest from all their works which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and sanctified it. And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth. ([Abraham 5:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)).  
 
 The next time you interact with a part of this physical world, the trees, the ground, the animals you can see the physical manifestation of that plan.

### Planning
Although our creation of a website pails in comparison to God's creation in a small way the process of website creation can help us increase our understanding of our Heavenly Father.  He started with a plan and planning a website is a best practice that ensures we are able to deliver what is required. Website planning in particular represents an artistic creative expression that will optimize a specific outcome. 

One of the first web application development projects I worked on was to take an underwriting process I had previously optimized using office technology (Documents, spreadsheets, email) and create a web interface that would gather sales information from the sales team, and present the few specific criteria the underwriter needed to consider to make a decision in optimal time.  Compressing a sales cycle down from 3 weeks to less than an hour and providing sales reports to the CEO and other executives was a very rewarding project for myself and my employer.  Developing a website is so much easier when you have an effective plan to follow.  Taking the assignment seriously will greatly help you as you work through the rest of the assignments of this class and produce a functioning well designed website.

### Joining a Teaching and Learning Team
I have made a few adjustments to facilitate the Teaching and Learning Team activity for this and following weeks. Although the activity gives your options for different messaging platforms you can use, I will make it easy for you; **we will be using Microsoft Teams for group messaging in this class.** 

Click  to access our [Class Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aua2MjMmHxQl3Iz5mvloIHMl3n_a8HzFzD3YN2S15aZU1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=4365ea51-7d14-4717-93dc-f10f32a7782e&tenantId=e6ac1d1f-d695-4ef1-91d4-94cddef8be11). 

Make sure to download and install the app. Once you have Joined the Team select which team you prefer in the general channel. I will then add you to your private team channel. Keep in mind you will need to sign in with your **@byui.edu email address** to access our class team.  I also recommend **installing Microsoft Teams on your mobile device** so you can keep in touch with your learning team on the go.

### Student Presentations
Student presentations start next week. The following students have signed up:
- Jaden McCarrey - CSS Class vs. ID Selectors - which one should I use?  
- Daniel Ortiz - CSS Combinators
- Hugo Rivera - The DOM
- Steve Evans - Chrome Dev Tools

These students will post a link for their presentation to the discussion forum by next **Monday 10/03/2022**.  They will also monitor their specific topic thread and lead a discussion throughout the week on their topic.

I wish you the best in your studies this week.
