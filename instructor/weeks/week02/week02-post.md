# Welcome to Week 02 - Design Principles

Hi Class, Thanks to everyone who participated in the discussions we had last week.  I enjoyed watching your videos and getting to know each one of you a little better. Last week we spent a majority of time getting our environments setup for this class which included installing our text editor Visual Studio Code, and our software versioning system Git Hub.

## Versioning Systems
Versioning systems have come a long way from the first time I started working with one back in 2005.  At that time I was hired as a Solution Developer with a Financial Services company that worked with Big Data (before big data was a thing).  The versioning system being used was CVS and my team was in the process of moving to Subversion.  These versioning systems helped us keep track of software changes that were being contributed by a number of team members and allowed us to confidently deploy software changes into production; if there was an issue we could issue a few commands and return to a previous working condition very quickly.  Although working with these versioning systems prepared me to make the switch to git when it came along, the transition was still a challenge for me. Git's distributed nature offered many advantages and allowed for more sophisticated team development work cycles, however it still took time to master. Versioning systems and git in particular provide a valuable tool for distributed teams to work collaboratively on software projects. Keep this in mind as you add this technical feather to your web development cap. 

## Deployment Process
For this class you have created a simple deployment process (the process of delivering software changes) from your local machine (personal computer) to your web server (a pages view of your git repository). As with any deployment process, there can be a delay between pushing your changes and seeing them appear on the server.

Lets talk a little more about how this software development process should work for you in this class.  This is important as this is how your homework is turned in.  The process is outlined below:
1. Make code changes on your local git repo in VS Code.
2. Verify code changes locally using Live Server.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 iteratively to implement assignment requirements.
4. Periodically push changes to the server using git.
5. Verify changes made it to the server by browsing to your git pages url.
6. When completed submit your git pages url to your I-Learn assignment.

## Design Principles
What is the purpose of effective web design? The overall purpose is to use proven techniques to communicate a message.  Communication in general is the delivery of a message from one person to another over a specific medium or channel. Think of all of the components involved in this communication via the world wide web; you have a web server, network technology, a remote device (laptop, phone, tablet) a browser on that device and a person.  This week you will learn techniques that will help you create websites that are normalized (should appear the same or similar regardless of browser), responsive (looks consistent across different screen sizes), and implement knowledge gained from artistic and cinematic disciplines to tell the story and engage with the person interacting with your website using CSS.

## Teach One Another and Student Presentations
Throughout this course you will have the opportunity to do research on a topic and present it to your fellow classmates.  This week you will be able to select a topic you are interested in.  Topics are organized by the week they are due.  You will need to share your presentation on the Monday of the selected week with the class and facilitate a discussion regarding your presentation in the developer forum throughout the week. You can sign up for your desired topic in this [Student Presentation Sign-up Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xkP0YMJaJfFsH4y-JcY0a6NJFryVnMoyb7Hz6ot7l1s/edit?usp=sharing).  Students claim topics by entering their name in the column next to the topic.  Only one student is allowed per topic.  Be respectful of your peers and select a topic that has not been claimed.

Well I wish you the best this week in your studies.
