# Homework Feedback

Manuel congrats on completing many of the assignment requirement such as:
1. Naming folders correctly.
2. Using header, main and footer elements.
3. using flex in the header.
4. Valid html and css.

Here is a list of what you missed. Complete the items and resubmit to Canvas for a regrade.

1. Content needs to be centered.
2. kabob-case needs to be used for folder and file names so you need to update PortalPage to portal-page and purplepic.png to purple-pic.png.
3. html ids are also kabob-case so you need to update currentdate to current-date.
4. The html title needs more specific info to the page so include your name.

Manuuel, I really like what is in this page, congrats! 
Your content is formatted and centered on the page. I like how you outlined the course with your link content as well. There are only a few things you missed.  Make the changes and resubmit for a regrade.
The ony thing I noticed is that kabob-case needs to be used for files, folders html ids and css class names. You need to update your html element ids to kabob-case as well as the file names in images and scripts.

Wow Jennifer you did a great job on this assignment.  I am impressed with your attention to detail in this assignment; there are many requirements.  Make the following changes and resubmit for full credit:


image alt text needs to be human readable; imaging you are having the page read to you by a screen reader, what would you want it to say when it gets to your image?
