## Welcome to Week 13 - Capstone Development and Final Exam

Hi Class,

This week you will take your planning document created last week and start to develop the Bountiful Foods website according to the specification. You have this week and part of next week to get your website project done.  It is due on the last day of class which is 12/14/2022. In addition to working on your capstone project you will need to take your final exam.  As a reminder the best way to prepare for your final exam is to review your quizzes throughout the semester. There are a few questions that I will grade so don't worry when you receive a low grade right away, as I still have to grade a few questions by hand. There are **no retakes** on the final so make sure you **take your time and answer the questions carefully**. The best way to prepare for the final exam is to review the weekly quizzes.  

This is a proctored exam using Proctorio.  If you had issues with the quiz last week, make sure to resolve those before taking the final exam.  Most issues with Proctorio are handled by following these [Proctorio instructions](https://byui-ilearn.screenstepslive.com/m/85963/l/954091-student-help-proctorio-in-canvas).

There is no developer forum for the next two weeks.  You are welcome to post questions in the #general Teams channel.

All the best,

Br. Farnsworth
