## Welcome to Week 10 Weather API

Hi Class,  

Last week you worked with retrieving JSON Data from a file stored on your webserver. Learning to use the fetch api to retrieve JSON from a file has prepared you to work with an actual server API.  The world of API's is vast and you will get to work with an API this week to retrieve current weather for a specified city. Visitors to your chamber of commerce website will appreciate seeing the current weather for your city.

As you work on your chamber website this week keep in mind that it is your term project which is due next week.  You will have some additional requirements but you are almost done with your term project!
