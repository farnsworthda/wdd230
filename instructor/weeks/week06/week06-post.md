# Welcome to Week 6 - Responsive Images

Hi Class,

I wanted to say how impressed I am with the quality of work many of you are doing.  Make sure to implement the feedback and resubmit your work so you can get credit for what you have done.

This week you will spend time learning how to optimize images and make them responsive to different screen sizes. You will have a chance to work with your favorite image editor. There are video and other resources that can help you work with a number of popular that are used in industry.  Throughout my career I have used a number of them.  My criteria for selecting an image editing tool works from a more broad perspective that contemplates work that is done by all stake holders involved.  Take a look at this [screencast of Figma](https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_cgom8hzu). Figma is currently my favorite Image Editing tool that makes this week's image editing assignment a breeze.

You also have a significant JavaScript assignment this week that will let you display the calculated wind speed for your Weather Widget.
