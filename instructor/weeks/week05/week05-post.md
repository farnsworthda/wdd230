## Welcome to Week 5 - CSS Design and JavaScript
Welcome to week 5 class! This week you will continue to build on your CSS and start working with JavaScript.  The JavaScript activity this week is graded so keep an eye out for that.  You will also need to exercise your creativity as you begin to create the actual content for your Chamber home page. 
 
### Teaching Teams and the Developer Forum
Some have wondered how they are to use their teaching teams.  You will be collaborating with your teaching team on your Chamber of Commerce project, so you will be posting a link of what you worked on and receive feedback from your team. The main developer forum will be used to discuss the weekly student presentation.  If you are not getting the feedback you need from your learning team, you can also post your question to the main developer forum. 

### Student Presentations
Student Presentations for the following students need to be posted in the developer forum today:
- Kevin Dario Salas Castillo - Frontend Reponsive Frameworks
- Abel A U Aguilar Aguirre - Web Accessiblity
- Cameron Reed - Writing a proper title and description

The following Students will be posting their presentations next Monday:
- David Ogbaudu - JavaScript - Event Listeners
- Chanae Ransom - Content Management Systems
- Leandro Lopez - A/B Testing

### Instructor Evaluation
I hope you have been able to learn from the feedback I have provided to you on your assignments.  This week you will have the opportunity to provide feedback to me about how class is going.  Please take a few minutes to complete the survey so that I can improve my teaching for this course.

I wish you the best in your studies this week.
