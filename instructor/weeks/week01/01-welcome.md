# Welcome to Web Frontend Development I!  

Your awareness of your digital surroundings is about to expand and I’m excited for you to learn these fundamental Web Engineering skills!  In addition to acquiring basic web programming skills, you will get hands-on experience coding locally and deploying your code remotely. In fact this is how you will submit your homework; you will submit a URL to your code running on GitHub Pages.  ***I'll say it again, homework assignments will be submitted by turning in a URL to your GitHub Pages website***.  This is one of the major outcomes for this weeks assignment.  

## The Evolution of a University Class
To succeed in this class you need to understand the role I play in this class.
Traditional professor responsibilities include research, course curriculum development and instruction or teaching.  These competing responsibilities can make it more difficult for students to learn as teaching may not be the professor's most pressing responsibility. Understanding how your BYU Idaho courses have been prepared for you will **help you get the most out of this class**.  BYU Idaho is a teaching university which means that they focus on teaching courses which directly benefits University students. BYU Idaho has created a teaching university by dividing traditional professor responsibilities over different groups of people.  Professors at BYU Idaho do not have research responsibilities and a team of professionals known as curriculum developers are responsible for the content of this class. That lets me focus on ensuring that you are able to get the most out of class by focusing on teaching.  I am an adjunct professor which means I am part time.  I have 24 hrs to respond to a question and I have 7 days after a due date to update your grades. Your most responsive answers will likely come from class members. 

## Hiking Treasure Loop
  To help you understand my role better I would like to describe a hike me and my wife Kristin went on a little while ago. We live in the East Valley of the Phoenix Metro area in Arizona.  We are about a 20 minute drive from the base of the Superstition Mountains.  We decided to hike the "Treasure Loop Trail".  My wife had hiked it once before with a friend who is an experienced hiker.  It was a pretty easy hike which was good for us as it had been a long time since we last went on a hike.  When we made it to the summit we revealed in the grand view of the Superstition Mountain valley that stretched out before us; it was spectacular.  We sat at a bench there trying to decide our way back. At this crossroads there were many paths and we were unsure of how to continue on the loop.  After speaking with some other hikers we struck off in a certain direction.  As we hiked, we seemed to be getting further and further away from where we were trying to go.  We were lost and the sun was starting to set.  We finally found a trail sign and discovered from our map that we were on a different trail. Our short easy hike turned into a much longer journey.  After finding the sign post we were able to make a course correction and then made our way back to our car, worn out and exhausted. I thought of how much easier our hike would have been if we had my wifes' friend to guide us on the trail.

## I am Your Guide to Success in this Class
This story provides a good example of how you can succeed in this class. This class is like the trail and I am like an experienced guide helping you find the best way to succeed in this class. My directions are like sign posts. If you follow them you will make good progress, if you ignore them you will wind up in the weeds and you will have to work much harder to get the grade you want in this class.

## Teach One Another
You will also get to experience what it is like to work as part of a professional development group.  Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have entered into a covenant to bear one another’s burdens that they may be light Mosiah 18:8. This is very true when it comes to web application development.  As we move through the class together and the challenges increase, you will be tasked with working together to help each other succeed.  One of the best ways to help each other is to make sure you are keeping up on your class reading and assignments and participating in class discussions. 

If you don’t understand something, **ask!**  The only dumb question is one that is not asked. In fact, you will learn how to get answers to your questions the way professional developers do.  The Developer Forum Instructions in the Student Resources section (Last module after week 14) give you great information on the process of getting your questions answered and will serve as a guide for our classroom communication.  These instructions point out the importance and effort it takes to ask an effective question. **Effective questions result in more relevant answers**. Please review these guidelines; your grades and your classmates will thank you!

## Optimal Rhythm for WDD 230 
I will post an announcement in I-Learn each week on Monday with instructions for that week. My instructions may be different than what is in a particular discussion or assignment.  If their is a difference between the assignment and my announcement **you are expected to follow instructions in my announcement**.  Those who don't, will be off in the weeds and your grade will reflect that.  The following steps provide an optimal rhythm for succeeding in this class:
   1. Read the Announcement for the week.  **You are responsible for all the instructions and guidance contained in announcements!**
   2. Take a peak at the assignment, compare it with the announcement and look for differences.  
   3. Take notes on questions you have.
   4. Study the assigned reading material and see which questions you are able to answer.
   5. When you come across questions from the reading or the assignment, post it in the Discussion Board also known as the Developer Forum.  Make sure to include code snippets, images, etc that will help you describe your issue **This doesn't work** is an ineffective question that will generate a poor response.
   6. Share answers you have to other's questions.
   7. Take the quiz
   8. Complete the assignment
### Additional guidance
1. When following this process make sure to participate in the developer forum every day. 

All the best,
