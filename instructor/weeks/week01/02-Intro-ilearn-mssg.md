# Welcome to Web Frontend Development I!
Dear Students,
My name is Br. Farnsworth and I will be your instructor this semester. I am so excited for you to expand your mind and grow intellectually and spiritually!  Your awareness of your surroundings, especially something you interact with every day, is about to grow exponentially so regardless of your intentions with this class, it will change the way you look at your world forever!  We will be learning about client-side web engineering this semester.

## Time Management
As a 3 credit class, you are expected to spend an average of 9-12 hours of work each week to complete the course.  10-15 hours might be a better estimate for this class based on your technical preparation.  Go a head and block out that time on your calendar now before class starts on Monday 01/02/2023.  Feel free to view the course now and familiarize yourself with it.

## Getting Started with WDD 230
To get you started on the right foot this semester, I will be providing additional information in the form of class announcements; **Make sure you read and understand all of these Announcements.**   To succeed in this class you will have to communicate with your classmates and myself.  You will be able to reach me via the I-Learn message system and the discussion boards. 
You can access the course by logging into I-Learn (https://my.byui.edu) and selecting our class Web Frontend Development I Winter 2023. Please read the course syllabus for more information about the course and assignments.  Remember, this is **not an independent study** course and you will **need to follow the due dates posted online**.

## Class Resources
You are blessed to have some amazing class resources to help you learn the content of this class in addition to me and your classmates.  You will also have a TA and a virtual lab offered each week with Br. Blazzard.  You will find the virtual lab as one of the activities in each week's module.   

If you would like to discuss a graded assignment, review the feedback provided before contacting me. To find feedback on your assignment, please review the article titled [How Do I Find Assignment Feedback](https://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/16998/m/65436/l/1215037-how-do-i-find-assignment-feedback-copied?token=qFM5FwQ58hAh15jjX9U5WF2v0MXTI2-m)?

I look forward to getting to know you better through your icebreaker posts next week.


All the best,

Br. Farnsworth
