# WDD 230 Class Commitment
Hey there,

I am happy to see you have participated in class (based on your Canvas activity). You are receiving this message because your canvas activity is below or far below the minimum of what is required in this class. I am concerned based on that activity that you will struggle or not be successful in this class.

Please message me back and let me know how the first week has been and your ability to commit to the 9-12 of work required for this class. If I have not heard from you by Monday 1/8/2022 I may consider dropping you from the class.

Your's truly,

Br. Farnsworth

# Class Status Request

Hey there,

I was looking at student activity in Canvas and noticed you have spend well over the estimated time of 9 - 12 hours of work with the class.  I just wanted to reach out and see if you were stuck on something so we can get you the help you need if necessary. I am open to the possibility that the time showing in Canvas does not reflect your actual work, but I just wanted to check and see how its going.

Please message me back with an update either way.

All the best,

Br. Farnsworth
