## Welcome to Week 9 JSON and fetch

Hi Class,

This week you will begin to build depth to your chamber of commerce site as you work on the directory.html page.  This depth starts to transform your flat brochure website into a functioning web application.  It will still appear as a flat brochure site but it will be a full stack web application.  Your backend will only be data in a file but that is a big step.

If you recall from your JavaScript class you learned about the asynchronous nature of JavaScript.  Like most other programming languages, JavaScript is coded and executed in a synchronous way where each line of code is executed in sequence.  JavaScript has the ability to step outside of this sequential mode and make asynchronous requests.  This is really great for web applications because it allows your web application to continue to function while it waits for a response.  Initially coding asynchronous JavaScript was done using callbacks and the code quickly descended into what is called callback hell.  Trying to follow that code or debug it was very difficult. You can feel thankful for the fetch method you will be using that uses a Promise to clean up the asynchronous code that is english readable.

As you work with fetch, it is important to realize that the result of one .then() statement is passed to the next .then() statement in the chain. It is kind of like unboxing a package.  The fetch request returns a box, and the .then opens that box.  Once you have the box open and can get the item, say a lego set you will have to pull that out of its own packaging which would require another .then statement.  Once you have the lego pieces, you start to build something with it.  This is like the last step where you take the array of items and create html markup to build out the page.
