## Welcome to Week 04 - CSS Layouts

Hi Class,  

Welcome to week 4! The tabernacle teaches lessons about the Plan of Salvation and the purpose of our lives through symbolic language and action.  The sacred space of the tabernacle is described in detail towards the end of Exodus and the first part of Leviticus. The reading can be difficult as it is more akin to reading an instruction manual.  Website design requirements, can be just as detailed if not more detailed than what you read in the Old Testament. So, this week as you learn more about CSS Layouts you can think of the sacred space God had Moses create with the development of the tabernacle. 

In addition to CSS Layouts you will be working with responsive menus using JavaScript and in your assignment this week you start working on the learning project. 

### Learning Project
The learning project is an iterative project, meaning it is something that you will continue to work on throughout the semester.  Each week as you complete your weekly assignment you will build more on that project.  The first step of this project actually happened last week when you created your Website Planning Document.  Hopefully you are getting a feel for the conversational style for the assignment grades. To be more specific, this conversation works as follows:
1. You submit your assignment.
2. We give you detailed feedback on what you have missed.  If you have missed anything you will receive an incomplete.
3. You implement the feedback and resubmit the assignment.
4. We regrade your assignment.

The only reason you will not get 100% on the learning project weekly assignments this semester is that you choose not to implement the feedback.
#### Looking Ahead
This iterative development/Learning process will conclude in week 11 when you turn in your completed Chamber of Commerce website in Week 11. This iterative development process is similar to the writing process with rough drafts followed by the final paper.  Completing each weekly assignment will help you easily complete the Chamber of Commerce Site for week 11.  This whole process is a preparation for the Final Website Project where you will follow the same iterative process to produce your Final Website Project.
