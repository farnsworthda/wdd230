## Welcome to Week 12 - Term Website Planning

Hi Class,

As I look forward to this week in class I was reminded of a few times in my life when the time for practice was over and it was performance time.  The first time that came to my mind was a forced 400 M sprint around the track for my 8th grade track team. I was actually a high jumper, but for this particular race I was ready to run.  I still remember how the gravel felt under my cleats and how good it felt to run as fast as I could.  I was quite surprised when I finished, not just in first place but I beat our fastest sprinter by quarter of a lap.  Needless to say, my high jump days were over and I had a great season as a 400 m sprinter.

The second memory is the roar of the BYU Marriott center crowd of grade school children cheering at the final beat of our BYU Ballroom Dance Grand Finale performance. The sound, the feeling, and the palpable energy from that crowd; I will never forget it.

Phase zero require us to transmit a dollar from one person's phone to another over Visa and Mastercard debit rails.  This chaotic project jerked around by high profile players with purse strings could easily be compared to the turbulent sea that frightened Jesus' apostles on that night He followed them walking on the sea.  We were working with network technology in a highly secure, fast paced, and innovative environment touching on every aspect of high tech in the banking and finance industry to make happen what had just happened.  The message was delivered from one phone to another and the money moved from one person's bank account to another.

Those feelings are how I feel about you making it to this point in the class. You have successfully completed a web application development cycle from planning all the way through to delivery of your Chamber of Commerce website. Along the way you have developed skills in color, and web design.  You have learned how to create a website that looks great and is functional for different devices, mobile, tablet, and laptop. You have used JavaScript to validate form input and worked with API's to provide dynamic content on your website. 

### Proving through a Second Iteration
In this class you spent 7 weeks (week 3 - week 11) to develop a chamber of commerce website project.  In these last two and a half weeks of class (week 12 - week 14) you will complete the same development process on a new project which will be your final project.  This process begins by creating a Website Planning Document just like you did in week 3.  You will then that use that plan to create your website.  Included in the Modules for week 12 - 14 is a Page called "Final Project: Bountiful Foods".  This document includes the content and development specifications you need to include in your plan this week and that need to be reflected in your website.  In this scenario, you are the website developer and the specification is what your client expects you to deliver. You will have the opportunity to share and receive feedback on your website plan this week, but after that each project is something you complete on your own. As you work individually on your final project do the best you can on your own.  You may be tempted to copy someone elses' work if you get stuck.  Don't do that! That is not honest is considered plagiarism and will result in failing the assignment and will be reported to the honor code office.  Just do the best you can on your own, this is for your own benefit.

### Final
Your Final exam is due next Saturday 12/10/2022.  This is a proctored exam so this week you have a quiz that will help ensure your system is setup properly for the exam.  The final exam is timed however that limit is more than enough for someone to finish.  The best way to prepare for your final exam is to review your quizzes throughout the semester. There are a few questions that I will grade so don't worry when you receive a low grade right away, as I still have to grade a few questions by hand. There are no retakes on the final so make sure you take your time and answer the questions carefully.

As always, I wish you the best in your studies this week.
