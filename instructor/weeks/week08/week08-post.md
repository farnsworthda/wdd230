## Welcome to Week 8 - Forms and Tables

Hi Class,

Imagine that you are with Joshua on Mount Sinai.  The mountain has been covered in a cloud of smoke and the glory of the Lord appears as fire on the mountain.  It is so glorious that the assembly of the children of Israel will not come near it and have asked Moses to mediate on their behalf with God. You follow Joshua and Moses into the glorious cloud and up the mount a ways. Moses continues further up and he has been gone for quite some time but now as he approaches you see he is caring something.  As you look closer you notice they are tables of stone and have writing on them.  You are told they were written by the finger of God. This is what came to my mind when I thought about our table topic :).

Tables are a great place to store information you want to keep safe and secure.  Modern day tables make that information available to end users and the task of front end web developers is to format that information in a responsive accessible way.  In addition to the table activity this week you will also be working with HTML forms.  

HTML forms provides a useful mechanism to gather information from an end user.  As you think about the forms you build make sure to keep the end user in mind; if you have put thought and effort into styling your form, your customer is more likely to work with it.  Styling is just one aspect of forms though, it must also be functional and anticipate user difficulty.

When you get to this week's assignment, pay particular attention to the instruction about field names.  Field names are html attributes just like an id, but they are not an id! The HTML id attribute is for client side use whereas the name attribute is for server side use.
