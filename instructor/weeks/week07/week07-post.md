## Welcome to Week 7 - Progressive Loading and localStorage

Hi Class,

As you work through the activities of this week you will develop skills that will help you to continue to optimize responsiveness for those people who will be interacting with your web pages.  These techniques let you work within the constraints of the web browser to produce a lightning fast response after you have done all that you can do to physically reduce the file size of your images. Quickly responding to the browser request creates a polished feeling for the end user which will translate into accomplishing the purpose of your webpage objective. 

### Student Presentations
Student Presentations for the following students need to be posted in the developer forum today:
- Gloria Rosado - CSS Specificity and Redundancy
- Evan Grizzle - CSS Pseudo-Elements and CSS Pseudo-classes

The following Students will be posting their presentations next Monday:

- Form Input Validation - Caitlyn Schmidt
- CSS KeyFrame Animations - Ari-John Katia

As I watched The Spiritual Whirlwind video included with this week's lesson I felt the encouragement of the Lord in the purpose of my own afflictions; they provide the resistance we need to develop and grow and eventually accomplish our eternal purpose.  It is a great way to start the academic rigors you will face this week.


All the best,

Br. Farnsworth
