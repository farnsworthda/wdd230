## Welcome to Week 11 - Chamber Site

Class,

It has been quite a journey to get here and I have enjoyed seeing the progress of your work. This week as you learn about usability and discover how to remove roadblocks for your users, I hope you will keep your mind and heart open to roadblocks you can help remove for your fellow classmates and those in your family and community. 

You have this week to finalize your work on your chamber website. There is no virtual lab this week so make sure to collect the feedback you need from your learning team and the developer forum to ensure you get the grade you desire. Unlike previous assignments this semester, your term project is worth 100 points.

All the best,

Br. Farnsworth
